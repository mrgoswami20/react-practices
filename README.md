# React Practice Journey README

Welcome to my React practice journey! ðŸš€

## Introduction

I'm excited to embark on this journey to hone my skills in React and its related technologies. This README will serve as a record of my progress and goals throughout this endeavour.

## Goals

- **Practice React:** I aim to deepen my understanding of React by working on various projects, implementing different features, and experimenting with different approaches.
  
- **Master Redux:** Understanding and effectively implementing Redux is a key aspect of modern React development. I will dedicate time to learning and integrating Redux principles into my projects.
  
- **JavaScript Proficiency:** JavaScript is the backbone of React development. I will continue to enhance my JavaScript skills, exploring advanced concepts and best practices.
  
- **Explore Tailwind CSS:** Tailwind CSS offers a utility-first approach to styling, which can greatly streamline the development process. I'm eager to learn how to leverage its power effectively.
  
- **Utilize Vite:** Vite is a modern build tool for front-end development that promises blazing-fast development server and build times. I'll integrate Vite into my workflow and explore its capabilities.

## Progress
